                <h1>Backstory</h1> 
                <p>
                  The path which led to inventing the formula for Enchant 22 facial mask was not an easy journey.
                  This innovative project was absolutely satisfactory and fulfilling. All the reseacrh info I went through to learn about plants & elements, all
                  the uncharted territorries of Sydney to explore natural elements, and sourcing exotic ingredients across globe 
                  even amidst of pandemic and testing out on subjects including me to measure effectiveness & develop the product, 
                  every moment was worth it! </p>

                  <p>
                    The real challenge arised years ago when I was in first year at Uni, I was wearing make-up everyday at Uni & for work.
                    I really loved the feel of wearing make-up. But the long-wear makeup used to cause acne on my skin, no matter 
                    how carefully I chose non-comedogenic makeup. Also, due to my IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), by default, my skin 
                    was sensitive and had to deal with congestion flare-ups all year round and eventually resulting into acne spots & blemishes.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The more acne appeared from the make-up usage, the more I had to use make up next day to cover it up and the
                    more acne showed up, the loop continued even though I was sincere about removing makeup every night. The continual struggle rewired
                    my sense of self in a way that it crushed my confidence to go out without makeup. And I would always worry about my skin
                    as I had to cover up skin flaws with makeup layers.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I found that sheet masks produce temporary results. So, I started doing LED light facials and enzymes, but it
                    was an ongoing process. As a Uni student, it was hard to keep up with the spending every two weeks and again
                    the results were temporary. Though I was questioning the progress of it in my mind, and then finally, when I met mom during Christmas break, she pointed out that my skin looked like
                    it's burnt.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    That's when I decided to find out that there must be a way to solve it. I became curious to know more about
                    effectiveness of elements of natural origin and started developing this facial mask and initially testing out on me 
                    and friends who had similar struggles and sensitive skin. The latest version (2nd version) of had been completed on
                    22nd March '21. This facial mask is 100% of natural origin, therefore, always safe to use.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    
                    Goal:
                    The formula of this facial mask is developed with the goal of being an ultimate product which will work
                    as a facial mask (to detoxify and deep clean the skin from makeup residue), and also can work as a face scrub
                    (coffee grains added for this property) and be a replinishing food for skin to restore skin's natural glow.
                    Aditionally, fruits containing vitamin C is added for brightening and to reduce large pores.
